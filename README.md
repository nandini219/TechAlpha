#WEB DEVELOPMENT
An internship in web development provides hands-on experience in building websites, equipping participants with essential skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) forms the backbone of web pages, defining their structure and content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is then used to enhance the presentation of these pages, enabling designers to customize layouts, colors, and typography. Meanwhile, JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites, allowing for features like animations, form validation, and responsive behavior.
